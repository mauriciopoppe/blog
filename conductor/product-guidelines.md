# Product Guidelines

## Prose Style
- **Adaptive Tone:** The prose style should adapt to the content type:
    - **Technical Tutorials:** Technical, concise, and precise. Focus on facts, code, and math.
    - **Personal Reflections/Friendly Articles:** More conversational, engaging, and anecdotal while maintaining professional clarity.
    - **Math & Research:** Rigorous and objective, mirroring the structure of academic writing.

## Design Principles
- **Generous Whitespace:** Prioritize legibility and a calm reading environment. High "breathing room" is essential for helping readers process dense technical concepts without unnecessary cognitive load.
- **Content-First Layout:** The UI should recede into the background, ensuring that the text, math, and code are the primary focus of the page.

## Interactive Experience (The Sandbox)
- **Inline Integration:** Interactive experiments should be integrated as focused, inline components within the narrative flow. This allows the reader to interact with a concept immediately after reading about it, reinforcing learning in context.
- **Performance Focused:** Sandbox components must be optimized to ensure that the initial page load and scrolling experience remain smooth even with multiple demos.

## Accessibility & Standards
- **Semantic HTML:** Use proper HTML elements (headings, articles, sections) to provide a clear document structure for screen readers and search engines.
- **Universal Access:** Ensure that core technical information is not gated behind complex interactions; the primary prose should be understandable even if interactive elements are disabled.

## Technical Presentation
- **Utility-First Artifacts:** Code blocks and mathematical formulas must be easy to copy and reference. High-quality syntax highlighting and clear font choices for math (e.g., KaTeX/MathJax) are non-negotiable.
- **Consistent Syntax:** Use established conventions for mathematical notation and coding styles across all articles to provide a coherent learning experience.
