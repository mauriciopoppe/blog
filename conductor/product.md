# Initial Concept
A personal blog and technical sandbox for experiments in computer graphics, math, and engineering.

# Product Guide

## Vision
To create a high-quality, professional, yet experimental digital space that serves as both a scholarly notebook for technical documentation and a creative gallery for interactive visual experiments. This project aims to bridge the gap between rigorous technical writing and playful, visual exploration.

## Target Audience
- **Software Engineers and Developers:** Looking for tutorials, deep-dives into code, and practical engineering insights.
- **Computer Graphics and Math Enthusiasts:** Interested in visual algorithms, geometry, and mathematical visualizations.
- **Personal Network:** Friends, family, and colleagues interested in following personal growth and professional milestones.

## Goals
- **Learning & Documentation:** To serve as a primary record of technical learning, personal experiments, and "Today I Learned" (TIL) moments.
- **Knowledge Sharing:** To provide value to the community by publishing clear, well-explained tutorials and insights on engineering, math, and graphics.
- **Professional Portfolio:** To demonstrate expertise and creative capability through a polished, interactive body of work.

## Core Features
- **Scholarly Technical Notes:** High-readability content with robust support for mathematical notation and code syntax highlighting.
- **Interactive Sandbox:** A dedicated area for 2D and 3D graphics experiments, leveraging React, Three.js, and d3.js to bring concepts to life.
- **Unified Navigation:** A seamless experience between reading static articles and interacting with dynamic sandbox environments.

## Brand Identity & Vibe
- **Minimalist & Scholarly:** The design focuses on readability and content, evoking the feel of a high-end digital laboratory notebook.
- **Creative & Experimental:** The "Sandbox" elements provide a playground for visual innovation, showing a willingness to push technical boundaries.
- **Professional & Direct:** Information is organized logically, with a tone that is clear, authoritative, and respectful of the reader's time.

## Prioritized Content Types
- **Long-form Technical Tutorials:** Comprehensive guides that teach complex topics from first principles.
- **TIL & Code Snippets:** Quick, searchable notes on specific technical hurdles or interesting discoveries.
- **Visual & Interactive Demos:** Post-driven experiments that showcase computer graphics, animations, and data visualizations.
