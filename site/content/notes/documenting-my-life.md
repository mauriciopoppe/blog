## Why am I documenting my life?

Ordinary moments don't have a value right now but they will value over time.
We might think that mundane things will stay the same forever but they don't.

[I took the following notes from a vlogger that I admire called Riza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fO43lbqSOkU):

> *Because we don't know when we will die, we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well.
Yet everything happens only a certain number of times, and a very small number really.*
>
> *How many more times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood,
an afternoon that is so deeply a part of your being that you can't even conceive of your life without it?
Perhaps four, five times more, perhaps not even that.*
>
> *How many more times will you watch the full moon rise? Perhaps 20. And yet it all seems limitless.*

<div class="columns is-size-3 has-text-primary">
  <div class="column is-half is-offset-one-quarter has-text-centered">
    <p>Life goes by fast, I want to do my best to remember it.</p>
  </div>
</div>

*How should I do it?* Journaling, photos and videos. Journalism is the easiest. It's great to read old
entries and see how much you grew as a person. I'm a fan of Riza's videos and it seems fun to
create them so I'll also do video blogs.

*So if you record your life, what are you going to use?*
I'll get a camera and I'll start with one that's the most convenient to use.
I'll also learn to edit videos because I want to romanticize my life by recording my adventures
as something that my future self would like.

I'm the subject and reporter of my own life, when I talk to myself in a video
it's like I'm asking questions and answering them out loud.

## Journaling

I have a google doc where every night I write an entry about my day, sometimes I forget
to do it but that's ok, it doesn't need to be perfect and it can have as much detail
as I want to. It's a google doc for now but I feel I'd value a physical journal a lot because
I could hand write it! Maybe I'll do that later.

There's a template at the top with the following questions:

```
[today's date]

* I am grateful for:
* Positive self affirmation:
* What did I experience today?
* Good for someone today?
* What will I do better tomorrow?
```

I also have a special doc for dreams, I'm trying to get better at being
able to have vivid dreams where I remember more details of my dreams,
regardless of having a happy or sad vivid dream I record it so my
future self can remember it.

## Photos

I got myself an instax camera and I used in a trip abroad, while I'm able to capture things
in the moment with my phone and I can share them online it doesn't have the same
value as taking a physical picture in the moment and sharing it with someone.

## Video

I decided to get a nice vlogging camera called DJI Osmo Pocket 3, it's great
because it very compact and has a stabilizer. I learned the basics about photography
and video editing with Davinci Resolve and I practice to summarize a series of
random clips that I took during a day.

## Reflecting on my life

Every 4 months I write a small essay about my life for that 4 month period.
Every year on my birthday I wrote a longer essay about my life during the last year.
I capture highlights about the things that I did and progress on the objectives I set for myself
in a previous essay. Writing these thoughts is a great way to reflect on my life.

To help me on this reflection I use NotebookLM which helps me remember details of my life,
I chat with it to see big picture topics in the goals I've set. This is an interesting
way to do therapy :).
