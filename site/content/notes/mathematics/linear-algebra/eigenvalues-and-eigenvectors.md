title: "Eigenvalues and eigenvectors"
description: |
  An eigenvalue represents how the object scales (or stretches/compresses) a particular direction (or eigenvector) when acted upon by the object. This article covers how to find these values in
  a square matrix as well as how it's applicable in compute graphics.

Given an square matrix $\mathbf{M}$

- an *eigenvector* $\mathbf{v}$ is a non-zero vector whose direction doesn't change when multiplied by $\mathbf{M}$, note that $\mathbf{M}$ has an eigenvector then there are an infinite number of eigenvectors (vectors parallel to $\mathbf{v}$)
- an *eigvenvalue* $\lambda$ is the scale factor associated with some *eigenvector* $\mathbf{v}$ of $\mathbf{M}$ has after the multiplication with $\mathbf{M}$

<div>$$
\begin{equation} \label{eigenvector}
\mathbf{Mv} = \lambda \mathbf{v}
\end{equation}
$$</div>

Assuming that $\mathbf{M}$ has at least one eigenvector $\mathbf{v}$ we can do standard matrix multiplications to find it, first let's manipulate the right side of \eqref{eigenvector} so that it also features a matrix multiplication

<div>$$
\mathbf{Mv} = \lambda \mathbf{Iv}
$$</div>

Where $\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix, next we can rewrite the last equation as

<div>$$
\mathbf{Mv} - \lambda \mathbf{Iv} = \mathbf{0}
$$</div>

Because matrix multiplication is distributive

<div>$$
\begin{equation} \label{eigenvector-0}
(\mathbf{M} - \lambda \mathbf{I})\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}
\end{equation}
$$</div>

The quantity $\mathbf{M} - \lambda \mathbf{I}$ must not be invertible, if it had an inverse we could premultiply both sides by $(\mathbf{M} - \lambda \mathbf{I})^{-1}$ which would yield

<div>$$
\begin{align*}
(\mathbf{M} - \lambda \mathbf{I})^{-1}(\mathbf{M} - \lambda \mathbf{I})\mathbf{v} &= (\mathbf{M} - \lambda \mathbf{I})^{-1} \; \mathbf{0} \\
\mathbf{v} &= \mathbf{0}
\end{align*}
$$</div>

The vector $\mathbf{v = 0}$ fulfills \eqref{eigenvector} however we'll try to find a vector $\mathbf{v} \not = \mathbf{0}$, if such a condition is added then the matrix $\mathbf{M} - \lambda \mathbf{I}$ must not have an inverse which also means that its determinant is 0

<div>$$
\left | \mathbf{M} - \lambda \mathbf{I} \right | = 0
$$</div>

If $\mathbf{M}$ is a $2 \times 2$ matrix then

<div>$$
\begin{align*} \label{lambda}
\left | \mathbf{M} - \lambda \mathbf{I} \right | &= \begin{vmatrix}
m_{11} - \lambda & m_{12} \\
m_{21} & m_{22} - \lambda
\end{vmatrix} \\
 & = \lambda^2 - (m_{11}+m_{22})\lambda + (m_{11}m_{22} - m_{12}m_{21}) \\
 & = 0
\end{align*}
$$</div>

From \eqref{lambda} we can find two values for $\lambda$ which may be unique/imaginary, a similar manipulation for a $n \times n$ matrix will yield an $n$th degree polynomial, for $n \leq 4$ we can compute the solutions by analytical methods, for $n > 4$ only numeric methods are used

The associated eigenvector can be found by solving \eqref{eigenvector-0}

<div>$$
\begin{bmatrix}
m_{11} - \lambda & m_{12} \\
m_{21} & m_{22} - \lambda
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
x \\ y
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
$$</div>

### Applications

List of applications

- if $\mathbf{M}$ is a transformation matrix then $\mathbf{v}$ is a vector that **isn't affected by the rotation part of $\mathbf{M}$**, therefore $\mathbf{v}$ is the rotation axis of $\mathbf{M}$
