title: "Cut-vertices (articulation points) in Graph Theory"
description: |

  A vertex $v$ in a connected graph $G$ is called a **cut-vertex** if $G - v$ results in a disconnected graph, note that $G - v$ is an induced subgraph of $G$ (meaning that $G - v$ contains all the vertices of $G$ but $v$ and a set of edges $G - V$ where $V$ consists of all the edges incident to $v$).

  <br />
  In this article I implement an algorthm to find the articulation points in an undirected graph,
  also I explain biconnected components in an undirected graph and explain concepts such as
  edge connectivity and vertex connectivity.

All the facts/properties below are considered for an undirected connected graph $G$

- if $v$ is a vertex incident with a bridge in a graph $G$ then $v$ is a cut-vertex if $deg(v) \geq 2$ (if $deg(v) = 1$ then $v$ is an end-vertex of $G$ so $G - v$ is still connected)
- given that the order $G$ is $\geq 3$, if it contains a bridge then it also contains a cut-vertex
- if $v$ is a cut-vertex of $G$ and $u$, $w$ are vertices in different components formed by $G - v$ then $v$ is part of every $u-w$ path in $G$
- let $u \in V(G)$, if $v$ is a vertex that is farthest from $u$ then $v$ is not a cut-vertex

Let $G$ be an undirected graph, by analyzing the properties of the dfs tree we can determine if a vertex is an articulation point given the following facts:

- a leaf vertex is not an cut-vertex
- let $u$ and $v$ be two vertices of the dfs such that $u$ is an antecesor of $v$
  - if $u$ and $v$ are not adjacent and there's a *back edge* $vw$ to some vertex $w$  such that $w$ is an predecessor of $u$ then none of the vertices in the $u-v$ path are cut-vertices
  - let $u$ and $v$ are not adjacent and there's a *back edge* from $v$ to some vertex **in the $u-v$ path** then $u$ is a cut-vertex
- let $u$ be the root node of the dfs tree, it's an cut-vertex if during the exploration of its successor vertices finds out that it has more than one children i.e. the root has more than one branch in the dfs tree

### Biconnected components in an undirected graph

A biconnected graph is a nonseparable graph meaning that if any vertex is removed the graph is still connected and therefore it doesn't have cut-vertices

Key observations:

- two different biconnected components can't have a common edge (but they might share a common vertex)
- a common vertex linking multiple biconnected components must be a cut-vertex of $G$

Let $uv$ be an edge of an undirected graph $G$, we can keep an stack telling the order of the edges analyzed so we push it to the stack, let $u$ be a cut-vertex then all the edges from the top of the stack up to $uv$ are the edges of one biconnected component

## Connectivity

Let $G$ be a noncomplete graph without cut vertices, let $U$ be a set of vertices of $G$ such that $G - U$ is disconnected, $U$ is called a **vertex-cut set**

The graph below doesn't have a cut-vertex but it has many vertex-cut sets, $U_1 = {v_1, v_2}$, $U_2 = {v_2, v_4}$, $U_3 = {v_1, v_2, v_3}$, $U_4 = {v_1, v_2, v_4}$, $U_5 = {v_0, v_2, v_4}$

<div id="figure-cut-vertex-2"></div>

- the set with minimum cardinality is called a **minimum vertex-cut set**
- a connected graph $G$ contains a **cut-vertex set** only if $G$ is not complete

For a graph $G$ that is not complete the **vertex-connectivity** denoted as $\kappa(G)$ is the cardinality of the minimum vertex-cut set of $G$, for the graph above $\kappa(G) = 2$

- if $G$ is a graph of order $n$ and size $m \geq n - 1$ then $\kappa(G) = \left \lfloor \tfrac{2m}{n} \right \rfloor$

There are other measures of how connected a graph is, let $X$ be a set of edges of $G$ such that $G - X$ is disconnected or a trivial graph, $X$ is called a **edge-cut set**, the **edge-connectivity** denoted as $\lambda(G)$ is the cardinality of the minimum edge-cut of $G$

- for complete graph $G$ of order $n$, $\lambda(G) = n - 1$
