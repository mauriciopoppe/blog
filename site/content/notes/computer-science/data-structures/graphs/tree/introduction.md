A graph $G$ is called **acyclic** if it has no cycles, a **tree** is an acyclic connected graph

<div id="figure-tree"></div>

- every two vertices of a tree $T$ are connected by a unique path
- every nontrivial tree has at least two end-vertices
- if $T$ is a tree of order $n$ then the size of the tree is $m = n - 1$
