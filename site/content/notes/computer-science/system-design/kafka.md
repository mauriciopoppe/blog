title: "Kafka"
description: |
  Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform designed for building high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and scalable data streaming applications.

  <br />
  This article covers key designs in kafka such as how messages for a topic are shared into partitions assigned to brokers. Then we see some
  guarantees about producers, consumers and consumer groups.

## Kafka

[https://www.slideshare.net/mumrah/kafka-talk-tri-hug](https://www.slideshare.net/mumrah/kafka-talk-tri-hug)

### Key Choices

- pub/sub messaging pattern
- messages are persistent (stored in disk)
- consumer keep their own state (stored in zookeeper)

### Technology Summary

| Concept | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Brokers | Receive messages from producers (sequential write, push) and deliver messages to consumers (sequential read, pull) <br /> Messages are flushed to append-only log files |
| Topics | Logical collection of partitions mapped across many brokers |
| Partition | Physical append-only log files, a broker contains some of the partitions for a topic |
| Replication | Partitions are replicated, one broker is the leader and all writes/reads must go through it (replication is for fault tolerance only), replication can be tuned to write to N replicas |
| Producer | Responsible for load balancing messages among brokers, they can discover all brokers from a single one <br /> High level api: `Producer#send(String topic, K key, V value)` <br /> Determines the partition based on the key (default hash mod) e.g. `send("A", "foo", message)`  in the example below: `"foo" mod 2` <br /> No total ordering across partitions <br /> Guaranteed ordering inside the partition. Useful if the key is a PK, if so all the messages related with that key will be ordered. |
| Consumer | Request a range of messages from a broker, responsible for their own state i.e. its own iterator <br /> High level api: `Map<String, List<KafkaStream>> Consumer.connector(Collections.singletonMap("topic", nPartitions))` <br /> Blocking/non blocking behavior |
| Consumer Group | Multiple consumers can be part of a consumer group coordinated with zookeeper, **in a group each partition will be consumed by exactly one consumer** <br /> Consequence: broadcast/pubsub (If all the consumer instances have different consumer groups) and load balance/queue (If all the consumer instances have the same consumer group) |

### Useful numbers

- 50MB/s (producer throughput), 100 MB/s (consumer throughput)

### Applications

- Notification: A updates a record and sends a "record updated" message, B consumes the message and asks A for the updated record to sync its copy
- Stream Processing: Data is produced and written into kafka, consumer groups process these messages and write them back to kafka
