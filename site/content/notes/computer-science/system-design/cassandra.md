title: "Cassandra"
description: |
  Cassandra is a highly scalable, distributed NoSQL (non-relational) database management system designed for handling large 
  amounts of data across multiple commodity servers.

  <br />
  This article covers key design features of cassandra such as the usage of consistent hashing, the write
  pattern to a write ahead log and a memtable, the read pattern from the memtable and from sstables,
  and finally and most important, some examples about data modeling for different types of queries.

## Engine

### Features

- Consitent hashing
- Replication factor, replicas of the data across the cluster
- [Consistency level controlled for each query](https://docs.datastax.com/en/archived/cassandra/3.0/cassandra/dml/dmlConfigConsistency.html)
- Up to 2 billion key-value pairs in a row

<hr />

{{< figure src="/images/cassandra-replication.jpeg" title="Cassandra replication" >}}

- Replication factor = 3
- Consistency level = QUORUM
- Clients talks to any node, the node hashes the partition key and finds the location of the data
- Data is read from all the replicas waiting for responses until we reach a quorum

<hr />

{{< figure src="/images/cassandra-write.jpeg" title="Cassandra write" >}}

- Acknowledged when we write to both the commit log (append only) and the memtable
- When the memtable becomes full it's flushed into an SSTable
- Periodically SSTables are merged

<hr />

{{< figure src="/images/cassandra-read.jpeg" title="Cassandra read" >}}

- Check if the key is in the in-memory row cache
- Query the bloomfilters of the existing SSTables to find the record, if it doesn't exist then skip the SSTable
- If the bloomfilter says that there may be data check the in-memory key cache
- On miss get the data from the SSTable and merge it with the data in the memtable, write the key to the in-memory key-cache and merged result to the in-memory row cache

## Data modeling

### Goals

- spread data evenly around the cluster
- minimize the number of partitions read
- keep paritions manageable

### Process

- Identify initial entities and relationships
- Key attributes (map to PK colums)
- Equality search attributes (map to the beggining of the PK)
- Inequality search attributes (map to clustering columns)
- Other attributes
  - Static attributes are shared within a given partition

```text
primary key = partition key + clustering columns
```

Legend:

```text
K Partition key
C Clustering key and their ordering (ascending or descending)
S Static columns, fixed and shared per partition
```

### Validation

- Is data evenly spread?
- 1 partition per read?
- Are writes (overwrites) possible?
- How large are the partitions? Let's assume that each partition should have at most 1M cells,
 $n_{cells} = n_{rows} * (n_{cols} - n_{K} - n_{S}) + n_{S} < 1M$
- How much data duplication?
